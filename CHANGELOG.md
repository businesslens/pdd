# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Find your flow** (`docs/flows.md`) — a routing page covering every
  situation a Product Model can be in. Brownfield, greenfield, and
  greenfield-from-a-Blueprint each get a starting row; after the first
  evidence is attached they converge on one four-row matrix built from the
  only two things that can change, the model and the code.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-31

BusinessLens consolidates onto one site. The Platform is retired; the Blueprint
catalog moves to `businesslens.io` and becomes anonymous to browse and to pull.

The previous published npm version is `0.5.0`. An intermediate draft of this
release included authenticated Platform workflows, but it was never published;
the final `0.6.0` replaces those workflows with the anonymous catalog and the
pull-request contribution flow described below.

### Added

- `businesslens open <report>` expands a local Product Report back into a
  canonical `.businesslens/` Product Model, making `export` and `open`
  semantic inverses.
- `businesslens pull <blueprint-name>` anonymously retrieves a Blueprint and
  expands it without a user-facing `report.json` download. It writes a
  greenfield block into `AGENTS.md` and sends
  `user-agent: businesslens/<version>` to the catalog.
- **Features** and **business rules** are first-class product-model entities
  with their own directories, IDs, relationships, and validation rules.
- A `businesslens/report` library entry point exporting the Product Report
  schema, its cross-entity validator, and the canonical digest. It depends only
  on `zod` and never loads the CLI.
- `redactSourceEvidence` in the `businesslens/report` contract strips every
  repository reference from a report before it leaves its owning workspace —
  `codeRefs`, repository `entryPoints`, repository-relative `links`, and
  `coverage.sourceAreas`. Product-facing routes and HTTP(S) URLs are kept.
  `coverage.mapped` remains a model-quality signal, and
  `coverage.evidenceRedacted` records both that those counts describe the
  origin repository and that validation must reject any repository path still
  present.
- `businesslens-plan` and `businesslens-verify` skills for planning in the
  Product Model and verifying implementation evidence before merge.
- `businesslens-implement` builds the software a Product Model describes, with
  its scenarios as the acceptance contract.
- `businesslens-ideate` proposes candidate product directions as a shortlist.
  It is the only skill that never writes to the model.
- Draft greenfield product models, with missing-evidence warnings during
  planning and support for exporting planned Product Model Versions before
  implementation is complete.
- `blueprints/` — the Blueprint source layout, with a `blueprint.yaml` manifest
  and MIT-licensed content.
- `blueprints:check`, wired into `verify`, parses every manifest, builds every
  Blueprint, and rejects any that carries source evidence. It does not trust
  `contribute`, because anyone can open a pull request by hand.
- `blueprints:publish` pushes built Blueprints to the catalog.
- `resolveModelRoot` allows the model to live outside the Git root or without a
  repository, adding general monorepo support.
- A structured open-source documentation section with tutorials, individual
  skill pages, and deterministic navigation frontmatter.
- `docs/terminology.md` defines every product-model entity and separates the
  terms that are easy to confuse.

### Changed

- **Breaking.** `businesslens publish` is now `businesslens contribute`, and
  opens a pull request against `businesslens/pdd` through the `gh` CLI rather
  than submitting to a Platform. No API key is involved. The model in the pull
  request is regenerated from a redacted report, so it carries no source paths
  and is byte-identical to what `pull` produces.
- **Breaking.** `businesslens build` is now `businesslens export`. `build` still
  works and warns; it will be removed after 0.6.x.
- `export` emits a source-free **Product Report v4** at
  `.businesslens/build/report.json`, replacing the portable v3 `project.json`.
  The report carries no repository URL, commit, branch, or workspace metadata.
- **Breaking.** `.businesslens/` is now called the **Product Model** throughout
  the CLI, docs, and skills. "Product map" is reserved for a visual or
  navigable view of that model. Draft coverage is an evidence state and no
  longer implies a reusable Blueprint.
- Product Report validation rejects content that cannot round-trip into
  canonical Markdown and inconsistent mapped-coverage counts. Product Model
  validation continues to reject non-draft behavioral claims without evidence.
- `--catalog` defaults to `https://businesslens.io` and accepts any origin.
  Precedence is `--catalog`, `BUSINESSLENS_CATALOG_URL`, then the default.
- `businesslens-publish` is now `businesslens-contribute`.
- Skill runners pin the CLI to the version the skills were installed from rather
  than `@latest`, which could validate a model against an older published
  format.

### Fixed

- Report expansion is idempotent. `open` appended its coverage limitation
  unconditionally, so every open/pull cycle gained another copy and broke the
  guarantee that a pulled Blueprint matches what the catalog holds.
- Docs dispatch sends an immutable commit-pinned revision to the landing
  pipeline ([#2](https://github.com/businesslens/pdd/pull/2)).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- `build` and `publish` CLI commands, the `businesslens-publish` skill with its
  isolated runner, and the CI publishing recipe
  ([#1](https://github.com/businesslens/pdd/pull/1)).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-26

Initial public launch of the repository.

### Added

- CLI: `install`, `update`, and `validate` commands.
- Agent skills: `businesslens-init`, `businesslens-sync`,
  `businesslens-deep-dive`, `businesslens-validate`, and
  `businesslens-doctor`.
- The `.businesslens/` product-map format and its contract in
  `docs/format.md`.
- Claude plugin manifest and marketplace entry.
