# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- First-class Interface entities for supported Product interaction contracts,
  with exact Interface–Experience availability across Capabilities, Journeys,
  Screens, Scenarios, and Business Rules.
- Required Actor classification as `person|system` and `external|internal`.
- Platform-neutral Screen entities for meaningful web and mobile product views,
  including product-visible information, actions, states, capability boundaries,
  relationships, and optional public routes or deep links.
- Universal References on every semantic entity, with independent artifact
  kinds (`code|spec|proposal|doc|adr|visual|research`) and attachment roles
  (`intent|implementation|context`). Referenced content stays outside the
  Product Model and never replaces its prose or proves alignment.
- `businesslens-map` for initial adoption, scoped remapping, and deliberate
  Product Model coverage expansion without executing target code.
- `businesslens-verify` as the single post-build invocation. It classifies
  model/code gaps, negotiates only authority decisions, automatically runs
  internal intent-resolution or scoped-mapping phases, hands code corrections
  to a harness-injected builder, and re-verifies until aligned or blocked.
- `report only` verification mode, an explicit missing-builder handoff, and an
  unchanged-gap stopping rule. Verification findings are re-derived rather than
  persisted in a receipt or ledger.
- Accepted decisions covering [repository-owned files](./adr/0004-write-nothing-outside-businesslens.md),
  [unified References](./adr/0008-unified-references-and-portable-reports.md),
  [non-persisted verification](./adr/0006-verification-is-not-persisted.md),
  and the [three-skill boundary](./adr/0007-three-skills-and-one-verification-loop.md).

### Changed

- **Breaking.** Folder schema 3 and Product Report v6 are now the only accepted
  formats. Schema 1/2, Product Report v4/v5, and their compatibility paths are
  removed rather than migrated.
- **Breaking.** Feature is renamed Capability throughout the folder format,
  parser, SDK, CLI, skills, docs, fixtures, and Blueprint. `features/` is
  rejected; Capabilities live in `capabilities/`.
- **Breaking.** Experiences now declare their Interfaces and no longer carry
  `exit`. Journeys use Capabilities and exact availability, may cross Domains,
  and no longer declare one Domain. Business Rules exclusively own Rule scope.
- Domains are optional Capability groupings. Screens remain optional and now
  use exact availability without embedding visual evidence.
- The bundled Content & Feed Reader Blueprint now demonstrates the complete
  model, including cross-platform Screens, product states, mobile deep links,
  and external visual and research references.
- **Breaking.** The public skill set is exactly `businesslens-map`,
  `businesslens-ideate`, and `businesslens-verify`. Ideate also handles a narrow
  already-decided verification handoff without reopening broad brainstorming.
- **Breaking.** `businesslens validate` is now `businesslens lint`. The old
  spelling is refused with exit code 2 and a replacement message; it is not an
  alias. Lint output contains only `ok`, `errors`, `warnings`, and `counts`—no
  branch situation or authority inference.
- **Breaking.** `references` replaces both `codeRefs` and `links`. Reference
  records are strict, duplicate targets fail lint, code targets require tracked
  files, and missing local non-code targets warn.
- `coverage.status` now describes model breadth only: `draft` while the model
  itself is under review, `partial` with known unmapped areas, and `complete`
  when intended product scope is modeled. A complete model may have zero
  References.
- **Breaking.** Product Report v6 declares a `workspace` or `portable` Reference
  profile. Portable projection replaces evidence-redaction terminology and
  keeps only HTTP(S) intent/context References.
- **Breaking.** Coverage no longer contains counts, mapped entities, or a
  redaction flag. Entity totals live only in Summary; Coverage is independent
  from References. Blueprint open and pull preserve model breadth while
  removing repository-local Coverage source areas.
- Every model creation path carries canonical orientation in
  `.businesslens/README.md`. BusinessLens still never writes target-root
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or README files.
- Canonical report expansion now owns that orientation file for `open`, `pull`,
  and `contribute`; Blueprint contributions accept every valid model-breadth
  Coverage status and publish no source-repository provenance.
- Lint now requires the complete committed model shell (`README.md` plus a
  `.gitignore` covering `build/` and `cache/`), and CLI argument, provider,
  scope, slug, and catalog-origin errors consistently exit with usage code 2.
- Documentation now teaches three starting doors and one ongoing loop:
  `ideate → injected build → verify (including final lint) → merge`. Map is explicitly not a
  daily maintenance command, and lint is explicitly not semantic verification.

### Removed

- `businesslens-init`, `businesslens-sync`, `businesslens-doctor`, and
  `businesslens-deep-dive`. Their useful scopes now belong to map or verify.
- The `businesslens-contribute` skill. Catalog contribution remains the
  deterministic `businesslens blueprint contribute` CLI command.
- Git branch-state routing from lint and the internal `branch-state` module.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-31

BusinessLens consolidates onto one site. The Platform is retired; the Blueprint
catalog moves to `businesslens.io` and becomes anonymous to browse and to pull.

The previous published npm version is `0.5.0`. An intermediate draft of this
release included authenticated Platform workflows, but it was never published;
the final `0.6.0` replaces those workflows with the anonymous catalog and the
pull-request contribution flow described below.

### Added

- `businesslens open <report>` expands a local Product Report back into a
  canonical `.businesslens/` Product Model, making `export` and `open`
  semantic inverses.
- `businesslens pull <blueprint-name>` anonymously retrieves a Blueprint and
  expands it without a user-facing `report.json` download. It writes a
  greenfield block into `AGENTS.md` and sends
  `user-agent: businesslens/<version>` to the catalog.
- **Features** and **business rules** are first-class product-model entities
  with their own directories, IDs, relationships, and validation rules.
- A `businesslens/report` library entry point exporting the Product Report
  schema, its cross-entity validator, and the canonical digest. It depends only
  on `zod` and never loads the CLI.
- `redactSourceEvidence` in the `businesslens/report` contract strips every
  repository reference from a report before it leaves its owning workspace —
  `codeRefs`, repository `entryPoints`, repository-relative `links`, and
  `coverage.sourceAreas`. Product-facing routes and HTTP(S) URLs are kept.
  `coverage.mapped` remains a model-quality signal, and
  `coverage.evidenceRedacted` records both that those counts describe the
  origin repository and that validation must reject any repository path still
  present.
- `businesslens-plan` and `businesslens-verify` skills for planning in the
  Product Model and verifying implementation evidence before merge.
- `businesslens-implement` builds the software a Product Model describes, with
  its scenarios as the acceptance contract.
- `businesslens-ideate` proposes candidate product directions as a shortlist.
  It is the only skill that never writes to the model.
- Draft greenfield product models, with missing-evidence warnings during
  planning and support for exporting planned Product Model Versions before
  implementation is complete.
- `blueprints/` — the Blueprint source layout, with a `blueprint.yaml` manifest
  and MIT-licensed content.
- `blueprints:check`, wired into `verify`, parses every manifest, builds every
  Blueprint, and rejects any that carries source evidence. It does not trust
  `contribute`, because anyone can open a pull request by hand.
- `blueprints:publish` pushes built Blueprints to the catalog.
- `resolveModelRoot` allows the model to live outside the Git root or without a
  repository, adding general monorepo support.
- A structured open-source documentation section with tutorials, individual
  skill pages, and deterministic navigation frontmatter.
- `docs/terminology.md` defines every product-model entity and separates the
  terms that are easy to confuse.

### Changed

- **Breaking.** `businesslens publish` is now `businesslens contribute`, and
  opens a pull request against `businesslens/pdd` through the `gh` CLI rather
  than submitting to a Platform. No API key is involved. The model in the pull
  request is regenerated from a redacted report, so it carries no source paths
  and is byte-identical to what `pull` produces.
- **Breaking.** `businesslens build` is now `businesslens export`. `build` still
  works and warns; it will be removed after 0.6.x.
- `export` emits a source-free **Product Report v4** at
  `.businesslens/build/report.json`, replacing the portable v3 `project.json`.
  The report carries no repository URL, commit, branch, or workspace metadata.
- **Breaking.** `.businesslens/` is now called the **Product Model** throughout
  the CLI, docs, and skills. "Product map" is reserved for a visual or
  navigable view of that model. Draft coverage is an evidence state and no
  longer implies a reusable Blueprint.
- Product Report validation rejects content that cannot round-trip into
  canonical Markdown and inconsistent mapped-coverage counts. Product Model
  validation continues to reject non-draft behavioral claims without evidence.
- `--catalog` defaults to `https://businesslens.io` and accepts any origin.
  Precedence is `--catalog`, `BUSINESSLENS_CATALOG_URL`, then the default.
- `businesslens-publish` is now `businesslens-contribute`.
- Skill runners pin the CLI to the version the skills were installed from rather
  than `@latest`, which could validate a model against an older published
  format.

### Fixed

- Report expansion is idempotent. `open` appended its coverage limitation
  unconditionally, so every open/pull cycle gained another copy and broke the
  guarantee that a pulled Blueprint matches what the catalog holds.
- Docs dispatch sends an immutable commit-pinned revision to the landing
  pipeline ([#2](https://github.com/businesslens/pdd/pull/2)).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- `build` and `publish` CLI commands, the `businesslens-publish` skill with its
  isolated runner, and the CI publishing recipe
  ([#1](https://github.com/businesslens/pdd/pull/1)).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-26

Initial public launch of the repository.

### Added

- CLI: `install`, `update`, and `validate` commands.
- Agent skills: `businesslens-init`, `businesslens-sync`,
  `businesslens-deep-dive`, `businesslens-validate`, and
  `businesslens-doctor`.
- The `.businesslens/` product-map format and its contract in
  `docs/format.md`.
- Claude plugin manifest and marketplace entry.
