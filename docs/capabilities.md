# Capabilities

**A Capability is something your product lets someone do, and keeps letting them
do.** It completes the sentence "the Product can …", and it outlives any one
route, button or code module.

Each Capability is shown working by its [Capability Scenarios](#capability-scenarios):
concrete acceptance cases, each with a start, Steps and an outcome.

## In practice

| In the shop | The Capability |
| --- | --- |
| A shopper looks through products and reads one | Catalog browsing (`browse-catalog`) |
| A shopper turns a cart into an order | Checkout (`place-order`) |
| A shopper or the store withdraws an order before it ships | Order cancellation (`cancel-order`) |
| The payment gateway reports what has been paid | Payment settlement (`settle-payment`) |

The title reads naturally; the id is verb-noun. A Capability needs no
[Journey](./journeys.md).

## When you create one

Create one for each durable thing the Product lets someone do, not for a
function, an endpoint, a button label or one step of a flow.

### Split by verb, permission and place

Make separate Capabilities when the **verb** differs, when **who may** do it
differs (a permission of its own), or when **where it is offered** differs.
Everything else stays one Capability with several Scenarios: the same verb done
different ways, from different starting states, or chosen by a setting. See
[What selects decides it](./variations.md#what-selects-decides-it).

| What you see | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Create, configure, archive and delete repositories | Four: different verbs |
| Switching an item's format needs a permission editing does not | Two: a permission of its own |
| Restoring from the archive or from the trash | One: the starting state doesn't split it |
| Notification settings on one settings page | One, however the page saves them |
| Adding, changing and removing members of a group | Three: each list entry is a thing of its own |
| Requesting a password reset, then choosing the new password from the emailed link | One: the request has no outcome without the link, so it is one run |
| Signing up, then confirming the email from a link | Two: the account exists without the link, so confirming is its own Capability, joined by a [Journey](./journeys.md) |
| Entering a second factor after any sign-in method | Its own Capability |
| Searching, filtering or sorting the catalog | Part of browsing |
| A shopper and an operator both cancel orders | One: a different Actor is not a permission of its own |

The same verb reached from somewhere else (changing your password when sign-in
demands it) is the same Capability, offered there too.

## The file

`capabilities/<id>.md`, or `capabilities/<id>/capability.md` once it owns
Scenarios. The H1 names it; the lead says what it lets someone do.

```md [capabilities/place-order/capability.md]
---
domain: ordering
availability:
  - place: customer-web::storefront
  - place: customer-mobile::storefront
---

# Checkout

Turns a valid cart into an order awaiting settlement.
```

| Field | Says |
| --- | --- |
| `availability` (required) | Where it is offered, at least one place |
| `domain` | The one [Domain](./domains.md) it belongs to, if any |
| `references` | Code or docs behind it, as [References](./references.md) |

An optional `## Intent` section says why the Product offers it.

A Capability lists no Actors, Entities, Rules or Scenarios. Its Scenarios sit in
its folder, and what it changes is what their Steps say.

## Availability

Each `place` is an Interface without Experiences, or one
[Experience](./interfaces.md#experiences) as `interface::experience`, never a
Screen. List every place where someone uses the Capability: if guests browse in
a public Experience and shoppers in a signed-in one, name both.

Every place listed needs a Capability Scenario that happens there. Availability
is what the Product intends;
[`businesslens-verify`](./skill-businesslens-verify.md) checks the code against it.

## Capability Scenarios

**A Capability Scenario is one acceptance case for one Capability:** what starts
it, the Steps, and the outcome. It belongs to the Capability whose folder holds
it; one owned by a Journey is a [Journey Scenario](./journeys.md#journey-scenarios).

Write one for each outcome worth checking: the usual success, a refused
permission, a failed validation, an external failure. For example, checkout
rejected because stock ran out, not checkout succeeding on a Tuesday.

### The Capability Scenario file

`capabilities/<capability-id>/scenarios/<id>.md`. The ids are unique across the
whole model.

```md [capabilities/cancel-order/scenarios/cancel-your-own-unpaid-order.md]
---
kind: primary
routes:
  web: Web
  mobile: Mobile
steps:
  - text: The shopper cancels an order that has not been paid
    kind: actor
    actor: shopper
    entities:
      - { entity: order, effect: reads, facts: [Items ordered, Total charged] }
    contexts:
      web:
        place: customer-web::storefront::order-status
      mobile:
        place: customer-mobile::storefront::order-status
  - text: The Product cancels the order and releases its stock
    kind: product
    actor: shopper
    entities:
      - { entity: order, effect: changes, from: Pending, to: Cancelled, facts: [] }
    contexts:
      web:
        place: customer-web::storefront::order-status
      mobile:
        place: customer-mobile::storefront::order-status
---

# Cancel your own unpaid order

## Trigger

A shopper changes their mind before payment has settled.

## Outcome

The order is cancelled and nothing is charged.
```

| Field or section | Says |
| --- | --- |
| `kind` (required) | The Scenario kind, such as `primary` or `edge`, from `taxonomies.yaml` |
| `routes` (required) | Each route's id and name |
| `steps` (required) | The ordered Steps, each with `text`, `kind` and `entities` |
| `## Trigger` (required) | What starts it |
| `## Outcome` (required) | What is true at the end |
| `## Decision points` | Questions whose branches reach the same outcome |
| `## Edge cases` | One-line bullets: a condition and its consequence |

### What a Step does to the Product's things

A Step's `kind` is `actor` (an Actor does it), `product` (the Product does it)
or `condition` (something holds). An `actor` Step names its `actor`; a Product
or condition Step may name the Actor it is done for.

Every Step lists what it does to the Product's [Entities](./entities.md) in
`entities`, or writes `entities: []`. Each entry has an `effect` (`creates`,
`changes`, `removes` or `reads`), the States it moves between, where the
Entity has States, and the `facts` it reads, changes or fills in. The facts list
is exhaustive: `[]` means none, never "unspecified".

```yaml
- text: The Product stores the order as pending and empties the cart
  kind: product
  actor: shopper
  entities:
    - { entity: order, effect: creates, to: Pending, facts: [Items ordered, Delivery details, Subtotal, Tax, Discount, Total charged, Margin, When placed] }
    - { entity: cart, effect: removes }
```

A Scenario's **Ends with** is where each thing it touched is left. Across the
whole model, Step entries make up each Entity's lifecycle.

A Step at a public place names the person who isn't signed in, even if about to.

### Behavior nobody triggers

A schedule, expiry or retry the Product runs alone starts with a `condition`
Step carrying `unattended: true` and no Actor; its Capability is available where
someone sees the result.

### Routes, Steps, and Context places

Each Step's `contexts` says where it happens, per route: the Screen, Experience
or Interface. A route is the same Steps in different places (web and mobile
above); different Steps are another Scenario.

### Capability Scenario decision points

A decision point is an H3 under `## Decision points` with one question and at
least two `condition → outcome` branches, all reaching the Scenario's outcome. A
branch with a different outcome is another Scenario.

## How it connects

Entities change only through Steps, so each Entity's lifecycle comes from the
Scenarios. Screens offer the Capabilities whose Steps happen on them.
[Business Rules](./business-rules.md) saying who may are checked against the
Steps that act, and [Journeys](./journeys.md) name the Capability, never one of
its Scenarios.

## What lint checks

Errors:

- A Capability needs an H1, a lead, and `availability` places that exist, each
  with a Scenario happening there. It never carries `entities`.
- An availability place never names a Screen, nor a divided Interface instead
  of one of its Experiences.
- A Scenario needs `kind`, `routes`, `steps`, `## Trigger` and `## Outcome`, and
  its id is used once; every Step has `text`, `kind` and `entities`, and an
  `actor` Step names its actor.
- Each `entities` entry names a real Entity and its real States and facts;
  `facts` is required, except on `removes`, which has none; a `from` matches
  where an earlier Step left the thing.
- Step text that names an Entity's title must list that Entity.
- `contexts` maps every route, stays inside the Capability's availability, and
  supports the Step's Actor; no two routes visit the same places.
- A Scenario has an `actor` Step or an unattended first Step.

Warnings:

- A Capability or Scenario id that reads as a noun phrase instead of starting
  with a verb, or that shortens the name of an Entity the model declares.
