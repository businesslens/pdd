# Mapping rubric

Every format rule — Actors and roles, Interfaces and their division into
Experiences, Screens, Domains, naming, Entities, the Capability split test,
Business Rules and prohibitions, Journeys, Step and Screen facts, availability
in every context, Variations and what selects them — lives in
[format.md](format.md). This rubric holds only the mapping method: how to find
those resources in a repository and where the evidence stops.

## Inspect by behavior

- Start at user and operator entry points, then trace handlers or services,
  persistence or external effects, and observable outcomes.
- Read configuration, authorization, telemetry, jobs, and tests when they
  materially change product behavior.
- Use documentation as a lead. Confirm current claims in implementation.
- Never execute target code and never claim deployed or live state from source.
- Repository deployables, routes, commands, APIs and integrations are evidence,
  not automatic Interfaces. Map an Interface only for a supported Product
  interaction contract.
- Treat shared backend code as no evidence of web/mobile/API/CLI parity. Verify
  each declared availability Context independently; offering a Capability on
  two Interfaces because one implementation serves both is a question for the
  author, not a default.
- Read each Interface's access from who reaches its places in the code — which
  routes or commands work without signing in, which need a session, which only
  the roles that administer the Product, its settings or members, may enter
  (the administration area). `lint` cannot see this condition until Experiences
  exist; deciding it is yours.
- Read permissions from the authorization checks the code performs, never from
  names. A privilege that exists only in code is not product meaning.
- Read `languages` from the locales the code ships, per Product and per
  Interface. Content kept in several languages and a person's chosen language
  are Entity facts (format reference), never `languages`.

## Acceptance coverage

Capability Scenarios state observable acceptance for one Capability. Cover
primary, permission, validation, conflict, and external-failure behavior only
where the Product distinguishes them. Where the line falls between a Scenario
and an `## Edge cases` bullet is the author's call and belongs in the Coverage
round.

## Entity granularity

Apply the Entity test in the format reference: write `## Information kept`
first and read the count off it. Put both shapes and their counts to the
author when you can; with no author to ask, split and surface the unresolved
granularity question in the proposed delta. Once resolved, record the resulting
meaning without retaining the compared shapes.

## Places, not designs

The model records what an Actor can reach, see, supply, do and trigger at each
place. It never says how that looks or is built. One test decides every case:

> Rebuild a view with a different component library, layout, typography,
> colors, spacing, icons, motion and copy. Everything that would still have to
> be true is the model's: who can reach the view, what facts it shows, what
> abilities it offers, what conditions change that, and what happens next.
> Everything the redesign is free to change is design's, and the model says
> nothing about it.

Design — component libraries, theming, layout, typography, color,
iconography, motion, microcopy and tone, gestures versus buttons, breakpoints,
loading and hover states, navigation chrome and the order of navigation items,
and quality attributes that do not change what an Actor can do — lives in
`visual` References with `role: intent`, never in prose. Ordinary copy is
design; when exact wording is a product requirement, a Business Rule identifies
its authoritative Reference.

## Describe coverage

Fill `coverage.md` as the format reference shapes it. Coverage never states
whether behavior is implemented or verified. A small, honest model with
recorded gaps is better than a broad model built from guesses.

## Use References honestly

Attach to each resource what you actually read to establish its meaning:
`kind: code` with `role: implementation` for the code you traced,
`role: intent` for the spec, PRD or proposal that states the behavior, and
`role: context` for background you read. For code targets, prefer
`path#symbol` over line ranges and use only tracked files. A Reference records
where a claim came from, never that it is verified, and none is required — but
a resource with nothing attached rests on inspection alone: justify it from
that inspection and say so in the proposed delta.

Visual or research References may guide inspection. Keep their role honest,
never treat their existence as proof, and never run screenshot capture
workflows.
